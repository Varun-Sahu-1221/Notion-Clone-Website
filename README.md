A pixel-perfect clone of Notion's front-end, crafted to be fully responsive for a flawless experience on all devices. I brought it to life with dynamic animations and rich hover effects to make every interaction feel satisfying. It also features my own custom enhancements for an incredibly smooth, and attractive user experience.

Notion-Inspired Front-End Showcase
I've poured my passion for clean design and smooth user experiences into this full-fledged front-end clone of the Notion website. This project is a detailed recreation of Notion's beautiful interface, but with my own creative flair mixed in to take the interactivity to the next level. ✨

Key Features
Pixel-Perfect & Fully Responsive

A major focus was making the site look and feel great on any device. Whether you're Browse on a huge desktop monitor, a tablet, or your phone, the layout seamlessly adapts. I've made sure every component, from the navigation bar to the complex grid layouts, is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience everywhere.

Dynamic Animations & Hover Effects

What really makes this project shine is the attention to micro-interactions. The site is packed with a variety of hover effects that give satisfying visual feedback and guide the user intuitively. I've also implemented slick animations to make page transitions and element reveals feel fluid and engaging. I went a step further by adding some of my own custom-built animations, designed to be exceptionally smooth and enhance the modern, clean aesthetic of the original site. It’s these little details that create a truly polished and attractive user interface.
